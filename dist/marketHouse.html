            Here, you can find the food in your household and its freshness status. In our page we use color codes to show the freshness of your products and how close they are  to their expiration date. Every Item has a diffrente freshness status and they take different time to go stale, thatÂ´s what we use to make sure every product on your market house has the correct time left and you are aware of how fresh it is after you buy.
